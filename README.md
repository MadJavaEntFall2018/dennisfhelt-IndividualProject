<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p> I have trouble viewing my financial portfolio because it involves several brokers and funds. 
I have to enter one site and scan its pages to find information about the current prices of 
my stocks, any dividends that I have received, the percentage of growth in stock prices, etc.
Then I have to do the same thing on the next brokers site. I can't combine or compare any data
items between each site

<p>It would be nice if I could combine the functions and charts that each entity provided on one site.
Not only would it allow me to compare the data from each site on one screen, but I could also combine
totals from each site into a grand total for all sites.<p>
